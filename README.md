Hi, I'm Ashwin Krishna ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Fullstack Developer in training passionate about building web applications and continuously improving my skills.

ðŸš€ What I'm Learning
I'm currently focused on full-stack web development. Here are the technologies I've been working with:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Databases: MongoDB
Templating: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
I love experimenting with new frameworks and tools to create better and more efficient applications.

ðŸ’» My Project: E-Commerce Website
One of my recent projects is a fully functioning E-commerce Website, built with:

Node.js & Express.js for the backend
MongoDB for the database
EJS for dynamic templating on the frontend
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for the user interface
Features:
User registration, login, and profile management
Product browsing, filtering, and sorting
Shopping cart with real-time updates
Order management with various statuses (cancel, return)
Coupon management (apply/remove coupons)
Payment integration (Cash on Delivery and Razorpay)
Wishlist management and offer modules
I built this project to understand the workflow of modern web development, from the front-end interface to backend logic and database interaction.

I'm always excited to connect with other developers and collaborate on open-source projects. Feel free to reach out!
