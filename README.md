Hi, I'm Ashwin Krishna ðŸ‘‹
<br>
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Fullstack Developer in training passionate about building web applications and continuously improving my skills.
<br>
ðŸš€ What I'm Learning
<br>
I'm currently focused on full-stack web development. Here are the technologies I've been working with:
<br>

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
<br>
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
<br>
Databases: MongoDB
<br>
Templating: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
<br>
I love experimenting with new frameworks and tools to create better and more efficient applications.
<br>

ðŸ’» My Project: E-Commerce Website
<br>
One of my recent projects is a fully functioning E-commerce Website, built with:
<br>

Node.js & Express.js for the backend
<br>
MongoDB for the database
<br>
EJS for dynamic templating on the frontend
<br>
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for the user interface
<br>
Features:
<br>
User registration, login, and profile management
<br>
Product browsing, filtering, and sorting
<br>
Shopping cart with real-time updates
<br>
Order management with various statuses (cancel, return)
<br>
Coupon management (apply/remove coupons)
<br>
Payment integration (Cash on Delivery and Razorpay)

I built this project to understand the workflow of modern web development, from the front-end interface to backend logic and database interaction.
